- [ ] Ports available: 3000-3004, 4001-4009, 5000, 5432, 6379, 8000

### Repository Setup

- [ ] Repository cloned: `git clone https://github.com/HealthFlowEgy/healthflow-unified-system.git`
- [ ] Latest changes pulled: `git pull origin main`
- [ ] Verified files exist:
  - [ ] `shared/database/init.sql`

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Initial Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd healthflow-unified-system

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build -d
```

- [ ] Command executed successfully
- [ ] No build errors reported
- [ ] All containers started

### 2. Verify Container Status

```bash
# Check all containers are running
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected Output:** All services should show "Up" status

- [ ] postgres - Up
- [ ] redis - Up
- [ ] auth-service - Up
- [ ] ai-validation-service - Up
- [ ] pharmacy-service - Up
- [ ] prescription-service - Up
- [ ] medicine-service - Up
- [ ] regulatory-service - Up
- [ ] patient-service - Up
- [ ] doctor-service - Up
- [ ] appointment-service - Up
- [ ] notification-service - Up
- [ ] api-gateway - Up
- [ ] ai-validation-portal - Up
- [ ] pharmacy-portal - Up
- [ ] doctor-portal - Up
- [ ] regulatory-portal - Up

### 3. Check Service Health

```bash
# API Gateway
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Auth Service
curl http://localhost:4003/health

# AI Validation Service
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Pharmacy Service
curl http://localhost:4001/health
```

- [ ] API Gateway responds with 200 OK
- [ ] Auth Service responds with 200 OK
- [ ] AI Validation Service responds with 200 OK
- [ ] Pharmacy Service responds with 200 OK

### 4. Verify Database

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker-compose logs postgres | grep "database system is ready"

# Verify database initialization
docker-compose logs postgres | grep "HealthFlow database initialized"
```

- [ ] PostgreSQL started successfully
- [ ] Database initialized message found
- [ ] No error messages in logs

### 5. Check Service Logs

```bash
# Check for errors in service logs
docker-compose logs | grep -i error
docker-compose logs | grep -i exception
docker-compose logs | grep -i failed
```

- [ ] No critical errors found
- [ ] Services connected to database successfully
- [ ] Services connected to Redis successfully

### 6. Access Frontend Portals

Open in web browser:

- [ ] AI Validation Portal: http://localhost:3001 - Loads successfully
- [ ] Pharmacy Portal: http://localhost:3002 - Loads successfully
- [ ] Doctor Portal: http://localhost:3000 - Loads successfully
- [ ] Regulatory Portal: http://localhost:3004 - Loads successfully

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing

- [ ] Can access login page on all portals
- [ ] API Gateway routes requests correctly
- [ ] Authentication service responds to login attempts
- [ ] Database connections are stable

### Performance Check

```bash
# Check resource usage
docker stats --no-stream
```

- [ ] CPU usage is reasonable (< 80%)
- [ ] Memory usage is within limits (< 6GB total)
- [ ] No containers restarting repeatedly

### Network Verification

```bash
# Verify network connectivity
docker network inspect healthflow-network
```

- [ ] All services connected to healthflow-network
- [ ] No network errors in logs

---

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### If Containers Fail to Start

- [ ] Check logs: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
- [ ] Verify .env file exists and is properly formatted
- [ ] Check for port conflicts: `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN`
- [ ] Verify Docker has enough resources allocated
- [ ] Try rebuilding: `docker-compose up --build -d`

### If Database Connection Fails

- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL is running: `docker-compose ps postgres`
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL logs: `docker-compose logs postgres`
- [ ] Verify DATABASE_URL matches POSTGRES_PASSWORD in .env
- [ ] Check if database initialized: `docker-compose exec postgres psql -U healthflow -d healthflow -c "\dt"`

### If Services Can't Connect to Each Other

- [ ] Verify all services on same network: `docker network inspect healthflow-network`
- [ ] Check service URLs in .env match docker-compose service names
- [ ] Restart services: `docker-compose restart`

### If Portals Don't Load

- [ ] Check portal container logs: `docker-compose logs [portal-name]`
- [ ] Verify API Gateway is accessible: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify CORS settings in .env

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails and you need to rollback:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Remove volumes (if needed - WARNING: This deletes all data)
docker-compose down -v

# Pull previous version (if applicable)
git checkout [previous-commit-hash]

# Redeploy
docker-compose up --build -d
```

---

## Production Deployment Additional Steps

### Security Hardening

- [ ] Change all default passwords in .env
- [ ] Generate new JWT_SECRET_KEY and SECRET_KEY
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up reverse proxy (Nginx/Traefik)
- [ ] Enable firewall rules
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Set up WAF (Web Application Firewall)

### Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Configure Sentry DSN for error tracking
- [ ] Set up Prometheus for metrics
- [ ] Configure Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (ELK stack, CloudWatch, etc.)
- [ ] Configure alerting (PagerDuty, Slack, etc.)

### Backup Configuration

- [ ] Set up automated database backups
- [ ] Configure backup retention policy
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedure
- [ ] Document backup/restore process

### High Availability

- [ ] Use managed database service (AWS RDS, Azure Database, etc.)
- [ ] Configure Redis clustering or managed service
- [ ] Set up load balancer
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling (if using Kubernetes)
- [ ] Set up multi-region deployment (if required)

### Compliance

- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Configure log retention (7 years for HIPAA)
- [ ] Set up encryption at rest
- [ ] Configure encryption in transit
- [ ] Document compliance procedures
